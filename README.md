## MemoryGame
# A game of Memory with nice images from the north sea written in Java

Select the size of the Memory Game in the starting frame (possible choices are 2x2, 4x4 and 6x6), opening a frame of buttons.
Clicking the buttons you will see images taken at the north coast in Belgium and the North of France. Every image is hidden twice.
Find matching images by clicking the buttons and imagine the feeling of wind around your hand and sand around your feet.
Clicking the same button twice makes it turn back to the logo. 
Not matching images will turn back to the logo after two seconds, giving you time to memorize them. Matching images will stay visible.

Hope you enjoy it :-)
